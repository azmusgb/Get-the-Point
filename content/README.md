# DECISIONS, DECISIONS — Content Candidate Pipeline

Status: **PROPOSED / NEEDS PLAYTESTING**

This directory is a candidate-content workspace, not a final commercial deck.

## Current pool

`prompt-candidates-v0.6.csv` contains **150 generic prompt candidates** across nine broad categories. Every row is a desk-review hypothesis designed to be tested, not a validated score.

### Candidate fields

- `hum_points`, `sound_points`, `draw_points`, `mime_points` — initial difficulty estimates only. Higher = harder.
- `*_fit` — expected route representability: `H`, `M`, or `L`.
- `representability` — desk-review screen, not observed success.
- `clear_target` — whether the word itself appears to have a reasonably unambiguous target.
- `audience_fit` — provisional mainstream/mixed-group suitability.
- `rights_safety` — `GENERIC_TERM` means the prompt itself is generic and does not intentionally depend on licensed IP.
- `accidental_giveaway` — must still be checked in real play.
- `status` — `PROPOSED_CORE` or `HOLD_AUDIO_RISK`.

## Important HUM/SOUND constraint

The audio route is unresolved. A prompt can be strong for SOUND and weak for HUM, or vice versa. The dataset therefore keeps separate HUM and SOUND hypotheses instead of pretending one score fits both.

`HOLD_AUDIO_RISK` does **not** mean a prompt is permanently rejected. It means the desk review found enough uncertainty in HUM representability that the prompt should not silently enter a final core deck.

## Required promotion gate

A prompt should move toward validated core content only after playtest evidence supports all of the following:

1. Representability through every active route.
2. Clear target / guess convergence.
3. Audience and cultural fit for the intended pack.
4. Scoring creates a real risk/reward choice.
5. **Decision tension:** once the point values are considered, at least two routes are plausibly attractive often enough that the choice is meaningful rather than automatic.
6. No accidental giveaway caused by prompt wording or route instructions.
7. Rights-safe prompt/content usage.
8. No persistent dead-card, pass, or dominant-route pattern.

Do not rescue weak prompts by merely increasing points. Remove or redesign them.

## Interpreting decision tension

Decision tension is not equivalent to “long hesitation.” A healthy prompt can be chosen quickly when players understand the tradeoff. Review multiple signals together:

- route selection share,
- displayed point spread,
- choice/decision time,
- route success and guess time,
- repeated one-route dominance,
- participant comments that multiple routes felt tempting,
- “obvious choice” reactions.

A card should be reviewed when one route stays dominant regardless of points or when players repeatedly indicate that there was no real choice.

## Data to join back to prompts

For every attempt, retain when available:

- prompt ID / prompt text,
- route selected,
- displayed points,
- success/failure,
- choice time,
- guess time,
- uncommitted skip/pass,
- timeout,
- round/timer condition,
- HUM vs SOUND condition,
- rule question / facilitator rescue,
- dead-card or obvious-choice reaction,
- strong positive reaction,
- replay interest at the session level.

## Promotion labels

- **PROPOSED_CORE** — suitable for formal testing, not validated.
- **HOLD_AUDIO_RISK** — audio-route representability needs special attention.
- **VALIDATED_CORE** — reserved for prompts supported by sufficient playtest evidence; none are assigned by desk review.
- **CUT** — remove from the working pool when evidence shows the card is weak, confusing, culturally brittle, or unbalanced.
