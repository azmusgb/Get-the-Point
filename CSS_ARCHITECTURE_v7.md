# DECISIONS, DECISIONS CSS Architecture — v7

## Active product CSS

- `css/tokens.css` — canonical product colors, spacing, radii, shadows, type stack, compatibility aliases.
- `css/site.css` — canonical shared public marketing/prelaunch components and layouts.
- `css/home.css` — homepage-only composition for the stacked DECISIONS, DECISIONS hero, product staging, mobile fold, route shelf, and other page-specific arrangements. It must reuse shared tokens/components rather than redefine them.
- `css/navigation.css` — shared desktop/mobile navigation and drawer behavior.
- `css/game.css` — canonical PWA/game styling, including setup, handoff, choice, HUM/SOUND, DRAW, MIME, results, modals and responsive states.
- `css/game-smart-card.css` — isolated **PROPOSED / NEEDS PLAYTESTING** active-turn challenger layered after `css/game.css` for the current smart-card experiment.

Compatibility entrypoints:
- `site.css` imports the shared public files so existing public HTML does not need duplicate stylesheet tags.
- `play.css` imports the canonical game files for old links/bookmarks.
- `play-polish.css` and `play-performance.css` are intentionally retired. Do not add rules to them.

## Brand-structure rule

Permanent identity remains black/cream-led. Teal/yellow/purple are current method-signal challengers and must not become hard dependencies of the wordmark, favicon, or permanent brand mark.

The stacked `DECISIONS, / DECISIONS` treatment may use restrained line displacement and a three-way branch motif. Avoid visual treatments that turn the interface into a literal flowchart or decision-training product.

## Page-composition rule

A page-specific stylesheet is allowed only when it owns composition unique to that page rather than overriding shared component behavior. `css/home.css` is the current example: it may arrange the homepage wordmark, physical-card staging, mobile route shelf, and homepage-specific responsive rhythm. Shared buttons, forms, typography tokens, navigation, route colors, and reusable component definitions remain owned by `css/site.css`, `css/navigation.css`, or `css/tokens.css`.

Do not use page-specific files as dated patch layers.

## Experimental-layer rule

The smart-card layer is an explicit exception to the normal no-override rule because the interaction is still under controlled playtest. It must remain:

1. narrowly scoped to active-turn presentation/gesture affordance;
2. clearly labeled **PROPOSED / NEEDS PLAYTESTING**;
3. free of canonical game-state ownership;
4. removable without rewriting `play.js`; and
5. either folded into `css/game.css` or deleted once the interaction decision is settled.

Do not create additional dated/stacked override files around it.

## Historical CSS

`styles.css`, `creative-direction-v2.css`, `creative-direction-v3.css`, and `creative-direction-round2.css` belong to archived creative-direction artifacts. They are provenance, not active design sources. Do not import them from current public or game pages.

## Rules

1. One authoritative declaration per active component whenever practical; do not append dated override blocks.
2. Product tokens come from `css/tokens.css`.
3. Keep unresolved game mechanics configurable in JavaScript; CSS must not imply a rule is LOCKED.
4. Use `--app-height` as the single dynamic viewport-height variable. `play-runtime.js` owns updates from `visualViewport`.
5. Netlify overlay handling must target known toolbar/drawer/badge surfaces only. Do not hide generic Netlify iframes or broad `[data-netlify-*]` content.
6. Mobile navigation remains available through the responsive menu; do not make navigation destinations unreachable on narrow screens.
7. Use `:focus-visible` for interactive controls and preserve reduced-motion behavior.
8. Prefer `font-weight:900` for heavy display text with the system font stack; do not rely on synthetic weight 1000.
9. Canonical HUM/DRAW/MIME styling belongs in `css/game.css`; smart-card-specific challenger deltas belong only in `css/game-smart-card.css` while that experiment is active.
10. Do not create generic or dated override stylesheets. Refactor the owning canonical component, use a narrowly scoped page-composition file when the layout is unique to that page, or extend the existing explicitly sanctioned challenger layer.
11. Experimental UI must not create alternate scoring, timer, persistence, or route-selection state paths.
12. The title may change again if legal validation requires it; keep identity strings centralized and avoid encoding the commercial name into game-state logic.
